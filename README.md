Dear reader, 

Welcome to the codespace related to the paper "Investigating the Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Writing Task Performance" by Omar Alminawi. Within this code space, there are 4 different files, each of which are briefly described below. Due to GDPR, the data used for this study cannot be publicly shared, as it can put individuals who participated at a risk of being identified. As such, the code is available to give an idea of the kind of pre-processing that was done, as well as the analysis steps taken to reach the final results. 

## NoyZhang_Preprocessing & Experiment_Preprocessing

In this folder, the preprocessing steps (data formats, releveling variables, etc.) that were taken for the publicly available dataset from Noy & Zhang's (2023) paper titled "Experimental evidence on the productivity effects of generative artificial intelligence" and the data from the independently conducted experiment are showcased. If desirable, the reader could download Noy & Zhang's (2023) dataset and apply the same steps that I did to come to the final conclusion regarding this section of the paper. The file includes steps to check for data cleanliness, an exploratory data analysis, steps for data preprocessing and cleaning, and finally, the creation of the different textual characteristic measures used. Attached to this is the file "Grammar-Sentiment", which includes the creation of the grammar and sentiment textual characteristic measures.

## Analysis_File

This file includes the steps needed to make the different regression models displayed in the study (OLS and Poisson), including the effect of GPT4 usage of textual characteristic scores, the effects of GPT4 in comparison to GPT3.5, and the possible moderating effect of occupation type. Additionally, the file includes a thorough analysis of the different regression assumptions for GPT4, including homoskedasticity, normality, linearity, and other assumptions. Finally, the file also contains an analysis of key regression metrics for GPT4, such as MAE and RMSE.

Thank you for taking the time to read this paper.

My best,
Omar Alminawi
